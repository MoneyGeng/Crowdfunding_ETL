Module 13 - project 2: ETL mini project 

This project was done by John adn Tina

most of this project was completed separatedly as we could not find time to do it together.
John had other obligations outside the bootcamp so he finished the jupyter file earlier in the week and saved it to the repository for Tina's reference.
Tina created and completed the sql db schema.
